## About
Overwatcher.gg is a mentoring platform for players to improve their gameplay with the help of highly skilled players. The idea came to fruitiion after noticing a need for stable mentoring programs to complement the rise of esports at the high school and collegiate level. As a former assistant Tespa coach and Top 500 Overwatch player, facilitaitng player growth personally and professinoaly became a passion.

## Planning
To meet General Assembly's MVP, resources were crafted carefully to ensure scalability and maintainability for future iterations. This resulted in creating only 3 additional resources including a join table, and adding columns to the existing `User` table.

Problem solving strategies involved were first creating a plan on paper, then translating it into psuedocode, and finally coded the solution. The [SEI issue tracker](https://git.generalassemb.ly/ga-wdi-boston/game-project/issues) helped with arriving at solutions with my own approach. Error Driven Development (EDD) and Behavior Driven Development spearheaded the remainder of the process.

## User Stories
As a user:

* I want to make a profile for this website
* I want to summarize my longterm goals on my profile
* I want to show my played heroes on my profile
* I want to show my gameplay footage on my profile
* I want to find mentor who can help me improve in my specific areas
* I want to look for mentors/mentees via the following: general listing and played heroes

## Challenges
This idea was originally for a personal project. Without the time constraint, early planning stages were capricious and complex, and lead to roadblocks early on due to accomodating many features in four days. The time constraints involved helped descope the project tremendously.
